# Goal of this project
With so many Chip-8 emulators out there, what is the point of another one? The answer is simple: to learn.
Essentially, this project is purely for learning purposes. It is not intended to be used after completion nor to be fully functional.

# Quick Get Started
```shell
$ ./build.sh
$ ./emulator
```
